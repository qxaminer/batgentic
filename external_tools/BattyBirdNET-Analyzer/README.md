# BattyBirdNET - Bat Sound Analyzer

## Purpose

The purpose is to assist in the automated classification of bat calls. There are some excellent classifiers out there. However, most are for other animal groups, notably birds, or are limited in their use to researchers.
The aim here is to provide a solid classifier for as many regions of the planet as possible that can be built into inexpensive, open systems. It builds upon the work of the BirdNET open source product family that has a similar aim for birds.

With this software you can

* Efficiently process a large number of recordings to detect sequences with bat calls, obtained e.g. from recording devices (audiomoth, any other).
* Classifiers included for European and North American species.
* You can generate files 'cut' to contain the detected calls, get a spectrogram visualization and a tentative identification.
* Meta-data in GUANO format is added to the segmented files that can be then cross-validate with other software systems to corroborate results.
* Train your own bat or other animal detection in normal or ultrasound using your own data or the one provided openly here as training sets.
* Set up a streaming internet API service that returns identifications of bats
* Use a graphical UI to do analysis of files on your PC (Linux, Windows) if you prefer that to the commandline.

The BirdNET systems are using a sampling frequency that is too low to capture bat echo location calls. So here I use the system at significantly higher sampling rates of 256kHz-394kHz or higher and cross train a classifier on the BirdNET artificial neural networks to identify bats. Think of a bat as a bird singing three times as fast.

Used by the automated, real-time bat on device detector BattyBirdNET-Pi (https://github.com/rdz-oss/BattyBirdNET-Pi), an inexpensive real-time monitoring system for bats, birds as well as your own trained classifiers (frogs, or whatever you like).

Key words: bat identification, bat detector, BirdNET-Analyzer, DNN, machine learning, transfer learning, biodiverity , monitoring


## Two types of Classifiers

BattyBirdNET-Analyzer comes with two types of classifiers:
* Classifiers to be run 24/7 that ignore noise (crickets, rain, electrical noise, ..) and detect bat calls and identify species as well.
* Classifiers that work on files in which it is already clear that there are bat calls contained, yet not known which species it/they are. Available for Bavaria and USA-EAST classifiers.
Use the '--no_noise on' option when using bat_ident.py.

 **There is a tradeoff in accuracy of species identification and being unaffected by environmental noise.** So you need to chose according to your purpose! If you want to run a system 24/7 to detetct bats in all sorts of background noise use the first type. Use the more accurate ones if you already have files in which you know a bat is singing for best results.

## Methods and data
The detection works by transfer learning from the bird detection network BirdNET v2.4. This network operates on 48000Hz and 3 second sampling intervals. This will not work for bats as their calls go much higher in frequency rates. Since the network is designed to identify bird calls it is still usefull for cross training for bat calls once the frequency range is adjusted.

The data for North American bats comes from the NABAT machine learning data set. The data for Europe was assembled from the Animal Sound Archive Berlin, the ChiroVox database and the xeno-canto database. It contains echolocation as well as social and distress calls in different quantities for each species.

The cross training / transfer learning itself uses the framework provided by BirdNET-Analyzer originally intended for fine tuneing the model to local bird calls or other wildlife in the human audible range. Essentially, it puts a thin layer of a linear classifier on the output of the BirdNET artificial neural network. Appears to also work for bats if sampling frequencies are adjusted. To cross train your own classifier on top of BirdNET set the config parameters in config.py and run e.g.
```  sh
 python3 train.py --i ../path/to/data --o ./path/to/file-name-you-want.tflite
```
This expects that your training data is contained in subfolders that have the following name structure 'Lantin name_Common name' such as e.g. 'Antrozous pallidus_Pallid bat'. The labels are parsed from the folder names. You can also have folders for 'noise' or 'background'.

### Data sets
The Bavaria and USA-EAST training sets (without the noise files) are provided as is here. You can use the them for your own classifiers
as long as conditions of http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/  are met.

* [ Bavaria ](https://cloud.h2887844.stratoserver.net/s/5LHQSC7SWqtHSMG)
* [ USA-EAST ](https://cloud.h2887844.stratoserver.net/s/YrEap2SAt8fRAzm)
  
You are welcome to use it accordingly, e.g. for teaching and research,OSS software and systems as well as for other non-commercial purposes.
The Bavaria data set also encompasses UK and nordic species. The data is a random selection 
from data from xeno-canto, chirovox, animal sound library berlin, as well as individuals (R. Zinck (GER), K. Richards (UK)).

If you have data, consider contacting me as the classifiers can only be as good as the data sets they are trained with.
Help us reach the goal of at least 100  samples (3 second recordings) per species!

## Install
You can follow the same procedure as for the BirdNET-Analyzer [see here](./README_BIRDNET_ANALYZER.adoc). Just remember to use this repository.

If you want to generate spectrograms, you need to install 'sox' for your platform and make sure it is in your systems PATH variable.

To use the graphical UI, you will need to upse pip3 to install pywebview and gradio.

## Usage
### Clients analyze.py and bat_ident.py
To identify bats, load your audio data into the folder named 'put-your-files-here'. The files can be in .wav (recommended), .flac, .mp3, .ogg or .m4a format.  The analysis is set to standard settings that should work for most by default. If you are fine with the EU classfier and hava python 3.10 version installed (check with python3 --version), then
``` sh
python3 bat_ident.py
```
is all you need to do to run an analysis on all autio files in that directory. Results will appear in a 'put-your-files-here/results' folder in .csv format. The audio files are analyzed and for each second one or two potential species are listed. These are the most likely bat species to made made the calls in that second.
You can also use the more verbose analyze.py
``` sh
python3 analyze.py --i put-your-files-here/ --o put-your-files-here/results --classifier checkpoints/bats/v1.0/BattyBirdNET-Bavaria-144kHz.tflite
```
There are several options available, most natably the area setting, e.g.
``` sh
python3 bat_ident.py --area Scotland
```
that uses a more area specific subset of bats and hence can reduce some classification erros. You can set the above classifiers via the '--area' flag. Further, you can also set analysis related parameters such as

``` sh
--no_noise  Defaults to off. Uses a classfier traine to ignore environmental noise. If you have no noise in the files, use 'on' for higher accuracy in identification.
--min_conf  Minimum confidence threshold. Values in [0.01, 0.99]. Defaults to 0.1.
--overlap   Overlap of prediction segments. Values in [0.0, 2.9]. Defaults to 0.0.
--rtype     Specifies output format. Values in ['table', 'audacity', 'r',  'kaleidoscope', 'csv'].
```
and hardware related parameters
``` sh
--threads    Number of CPU threads.
--batchsize  Number of samples to process at the same time.
```
you can also provide custom input and output dirctories
``` sh
--i  Path to input file or folder.
--o  Path to output file or folder.
```
A more complex example might look like this
``` sh
python3 bat_ident.py --location Bavaria --i test_data/Bavaria --o test_data/Bavaria/results --min_conf 0.4 --overlap 0.3
```

### Graphical user interface
Currently single file and batch file analysis are supported with English labels. You need to have pywebview and gradio installed, e.g. by
``` sh
pip3 install pywebview gradio
```
To start the GUI, use
``` sh
python3 bat_gui.py
```
it opens up a window and alternatively, you can use it from your browser on http://127.0.0.1:7860 .
Once you have analysis files, you can use the segmentats tab to extract segments.

### Extracting identified segments and plotting spectrograms
Once you ran bat_ident.py and have a result file, you can obtain the segmented audio files sorted by detected species using
``` sh
python3 segments.py --audio path/to/input/audio --results path/to/input/audio/results --o path/to/input/audio/segments
```
If you have put your files in the folder 'put-your-files-here', you can use
``` sh
python3 segments.py
```
If you use the above folder and know that you want to extract the segements at the time you run the analyis, you can use
``` sh
python3 bat_ident.py --segment on
```
and it will generate the segments to 'put-your-files-here/segments'. If you have installed the program 'sox' on your system (or sox.exe, a command line tool) and it is in your shells 'Path' variable, you can segment and generate .png images of the corresponding diagramy by using
``` sh
python3 bat_ident.py --spectrum on
```


### REST API - Online service
You can start an API service to analyze your bat calls locally or remotely. You set the area and other parameters once when you start the API service that can then answer http requests
``` sh
python3 server.py --area EU
```
e.g. using the client.py or from your remote/local application
``` sh
python3 client.py --i path/to/audio.wav
```
